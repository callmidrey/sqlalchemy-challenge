This is my Advanced SQL Challenge

This poject consisted of two main parts:
# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
This challenge was very challenging to me from the start and I personally had to hold on quite a few times to get the data loaded properly before I could rum the analysis. Majority of the time spent on this project was to load the data properly using sqlite and python files.
Hoewever, after the data was loaded, the analysis went smooth and did not take much time.
Two major visualizations were created and they are:
1. Precipitation Analysis

# Part 2: Design Your Climate App
A Flask API based on the queries that was developed in Part 1 was designed.
